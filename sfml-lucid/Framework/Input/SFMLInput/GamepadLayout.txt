Gamepad layout:

This is hard-coded but soon won't be. 

---

up
down
left
right
accept
cancel
action
menu
use
(and others I'm sure I'll think of)

For now you'll have to rely on this, but eventually it will be read from the config file.
e.g.: 

[KeyBinds]
action SFML.Keyboard.Key.Z SFML.Keyboard.Key.Enter

and use reflection to map the keys etc.
